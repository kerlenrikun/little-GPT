## 🚀 **Quick Start - 30-Second Setup**

Open your configuration file and copy the `promptx` configuration code below. This is the simplest **zero-configuration mode**, where PromptX automatically handles everything for you.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "-f",
        "--registry",
        "https://registry.npmjs.org",
        "dpml-prompt@beta",
        "mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `command`: Specifies using npx to run promptx service
- `args`: Startup parameters configuration list
  - `-y`: Auto-confirm
  - `-f`: Force refresh cache
  - `--registry`: Specify registry source
  - `https://registry.npmjs.org`: Use official registry
  - `dpml-prompt@beta`: Use stable beta version
  - `mcp-server`: Start service

**🎯 It's that simple!** Save the file and restart your AI application, and PromptX is successfully activated.

> **💡 Tip:** The configuration specifically uses the official registry `registry.npmjs.org` to avoid installation issues caused by unofficial mirrors. If you find the installation slow, it's recommended to use a proxy tool for acceleration rather than switching to alternative mirrors.

### 🌐 **Advanced Configuration: HTTP Mode Support**

In addition to the local mode above, PromptX also supports **HTTP mode**, suitable for remote deployment or special network environments:

```bash
# Start HTTP mode server
npx -f -y dpml-prompt@beta mcp-server --transport http --port 3000
```

Then use in client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### New to MCP? [Watch MCP Tutorial on BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HFd6YhErb)

Currently, all AI clients that support the MCP protocol can use PromptX. This mainly includes: **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **Zed**, **Continue**, and other mainstream AI programming tools, as well as more applications that are in the process of being integrated.

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

PromptX acts as a "professional capability middleware" between you and your AI application, communicating through the standard [MCP protocol](https://github.com/metacontroller/mcp).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your AI App (Claude,Cursor,etc.)"
        A[👨‍💻 User Interaction]
    end

    subgraph "PromptX MCP Server"
        C{PromptX Engine}
        D[🎭 Role Library]
        E[🧠 Memory & Knowledge]
    end

    A -- "Calls 'promptx_...' tools" --> B(MCP Protocol)
    B --> C
    C -- "Accesses" --> D
    C -- "Accesses" --> E

    subgraph "Enhanced Response"
        F[✨ Professional Output]
    end
    C --> F
```

When you call the `promptx_...` series of tools, your AI application sends the request via the MCP protocol to PromptX. The PromptX engine loads the appropriate professional roles, retrieves relevant memories, and then returns a professionally enhanced result to your AI application, which is ultimately presented to you.

---

**🎯 After configuration, your AI application will automatically gain 6 professional tools:**
- `promptx_init`: 🏗️ **System Initialization** - Automatically prepares the working environment.
- `promptx_hello`: 👋 **Role Discovery** - Browse all available expert roles.
- `promptx_action`: ⚡ **Role Activation** - Transform into an expert in a specific domain with one click. **(Includes Nuwa🎨 Role Creation Consultant)**
- `promptx_learn`: 📚 **Knowledge Learning** - Have AI learn specific knowledge or skills.
- `promptx_recall`: 🔍 **Memory Retrieval** - Look up historical information from the memory repository.
- `promptx_remember`: 💾 **Experience Saving** - Store important information in long-term memory.

> #### **💡 Core Developer's Experience**
> "The development experience with PromptX is truly different. Our team, using Claude Code combined with PromptX, had **one developer complete over 11,000 lines of high-quality Java code in just three days.**
>
> The value of this workflow is fully demonstrated in actual development. PromptX solves many pain points of using AI, ensuring consistent code style and quality standards at all times, which greatly reduces the learning curve for new members. Best practices that used to require repeated communication and reliance on documentation are now naturally integrated into every code generation."
> 
> ---
>
> "'Nuwa' makes it more convenient and faster for me to use AI roles. I found that I don't need to know how to code or understand complex AI principles. I just need to tell 'Nuwa' what I want in plain language, and it can handle the complex design work behind the scenes and guide me through the rest. 'Nuwa' itself doesn't write Little Red Book notes, but it can create an expert 'proficient in Little Red Book marketing'. Once this expert is created, I can hand over all my future Little Red Book related work to this new role, which greatly improves efficiency and professionalism."
